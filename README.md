"My Web Crawler"
================

That web crawler thing I always wanted to do...
-----------------------------------------------


Work in progress....

Using Python and Perl to build a Web crawler that simply goes out and fetches things randomly.  It is (or at least will be) robots.txt aware.

I don't have a real goal in mind at the moment, but perhaps it will have a use other than whetting my own problem-solving appetite.
